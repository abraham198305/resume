The <l>PWM</l> signal is generated from the Microcontrollers <l>PWM</l> module according to the algorithm written. The <l>PWM</l> signal is connected to the driver circuit which controls the power supply to the DC motor. The width of the generated <l>PWM</l> switching signal to the motor’s DC power supply is continuously adjusted by the control software based on the calculated difference in the sensed speed and the user desired speed. The user desired speed is sensed through a potentiometer which is adjustable by the user."

The routes containing straight lines with bends of either 45 degrees or 90 degrees are drawn using Microsoft Paint software and is stored as a Bitmap image. The Bitmap image is processed using the image processing algorithm written & implemented in <l>MATLAB</l>. The algorithm converts the Bitmap image to a sequence of ASCII formatted bytes containing the information about distances & bend angles according to the lines drawn in the image. The ASCII formated byte sequence generated by the <l>MATLAB</l> algorithm is sent to the Microcontroller through the <l>RS232</l> serial interface of the PC. The algorithm written using the assembly language in the Microcontroller decodes the byte stream received at the <l>RS232</l> interface & through its parallel port interface, controlls the voltage levels at the controll button pins of the RC kit's remote transmitter. The wireless receiver module receives the signals sent by remote transmitter module and decodes them. The in-built driver circuit installed on the Di-Wheeled robot drives the motors attached to its wheels according to the decoded byte codes received. The robot moves in straight lines for specific distance & turns at specific angles in sequence & repeates the steps until the signal transmission is completed which happens when byte stream transmission corresponding to the route completed remotely on the PC."
