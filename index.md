## Academic Projects
  - **Master of Technology (Embedded Systems)**
    1. ***Microcontroller based DC motor speed control***<br>Implemented a closed loop feedback based speed control software algorithm in PIC Microcontroller for a 2.5 Watt DC Motor using Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) switching of the supplied DC power to the motor. The speed of the motor is sensed by using a Photo Interrupter sensor setup across the spindle of the motor. The PWM signal is generated from the Microcontrollers PWM module according to the algorithm written. The PWM signal is connected to the driver circuit which controls the power supply to the DC motor. The width of the generated PWM switching signal to the motor’s DC power supply is continuously adjusted by the control software based on the calculated difference in the sensed speed and the user desired speed. The user desired speed is sensed through a potentiometer which is adjustable by the user.
    1. ***Feature extraction and classification of ECG signals using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Networks***<br>Implemented an algorithm in MATLA.B for classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals. Inbuilt MATLAB functions were used to implement the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ECG Database from Physionet is used for ANN training and testing of the program. The Statistical parameters (Standard deviation, Mean, variance, etc..) of the Wavelet coefficients of the ECG signal are taken as the features for detecting the abnormality.
    1. ***Wireless Embedded System for Powerline Monitoring***<br>Implemented a WiFi and IEEE 802.15.4 based wireless embedded system (Hardware and Software) for continuous monitoring of the electric parameters of an Electric Power Transmission Line. The system consisted of a pair of Hall effect based transducers for sensing the voltage and current on the electric line, Microcontroller with built in ADC modules for signal processing, WiFi and ZigBee based Wireless transceiver modules for wireless communication, Personal Computer for Visualization of the Time & Frequency domain, phasor representation of the voltage and current variations on the line. The software developed using C# and Dot Net using Visual Studio visulaized the following in real-time:
        1. Time domain representation of voltage and current waveforms.
        1. Frequency domain representation of voltage / current.
        1. Phasor diagram showing phase difference between voltage and current waveforms.
        1. RMS values of voltage and current.<br>

  - **Bachelor of Technology (Electronics & Communication Engineering)**
